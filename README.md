# Project README

This project consists of two HTML files: `index.html` and `about-me.html`, showcasing the use of Semantic HTML elements to create structured and meaningful web pages.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains a website layout with a header, navigation, main content, table, images, latest news section, and a footer.
- `about-me.html`: Displays information about a web developer named Jazreal Den Mark Estefanio, including skills, contact details, and links to social profiles.

## Features

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<table>`, `<img>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` for improved accessibility and SEO.
- **Styling**: CSS styles are embedded within each HTML file to define the layout, colors, and fonts for a visually appealing presentation.
- **Responsive Design**: The pages are designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for a seamless user experience.
- **Links**: Clickable links to navigate between sections and external pages like social media profiles.
- **Images**: Includes images from both external URLs and local folders, demonstrating how to display images on a webpage.

## How to Run
